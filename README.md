Welcome to the TF intermediate course!

You will notice there are 2 folders: one for the hands-on labs and the other for the pre-reqs (which containes the initial files that you will need to run in each lab).

Please keep in mind as we are sharing an account, we will need to keep the names for our resources unique.
